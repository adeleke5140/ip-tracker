## Boilerplate setup

I start out every project with some basic boilerplate and setup.
This includes:

1. Installing Vite and react-TS template
2. Cleaning up the default boilerplate
3. Creating relevant file structure
4. Adding in global styles
5. Initializing new repo

After that, I move onto mapping out components from the design.
