## Boilerplate setup

I start out every project with some basic boilerplate and setup.
This includes:

1. Installing Vite and react-TS template
2. Cleaning up the default boilerplate
3. Creating relevant file structure
4. Adding in global styles
5. Initializing new repo

After that, I move onto mapping out components from the design.

It's rough but does the job for me. 

The next step is to create a rough wireframe whichwill serve as a foundation
for me to build out all my components.

I use the [whimsical app](https://whimsical.com/) for that.

The mobile view wireframe gives me a better grasp of the type of components I need.
